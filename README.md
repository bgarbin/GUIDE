# GUIDE
Graphical User Interface for Differential Equations 

## Installation:



Requirements:
Python: >= 3.7
pyqtgraph: >= 0.11


TODO:

      First:     WARNING think about what to provide to kernel and to keyboard_keys
      - Parameters: - introduce ramp or modulation
                    - add plot possibility and according checkbox 
      - PDE : - do this
              - variable values and re-optimize (direct indexation?)
      - Parrallelize: - each dock's plot in a remote plot widget
                      - calculation in a remote worker
                      - multi process calculation for multi-equations 
       
      Secondary:
      - toggle for auto y axis
      - better "h" help
      - SAVE: - load state again
              - independant saving and calculation (for PDE) 
      - record: - at the begining remove the 10000 firsts points
      - astype for parameters specified as a 'type' keyword
